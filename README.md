# GRASS: Generative Recursive Autoencoders for Shape Structures

By Jun Li, Kai Xu, Siddhartha Chaudhuri, Ersin Yumer, Hao Zhang, Leonidas Guibas

This repository contains the pre-trained models for box structure generation, as well as the training/testing code for the generation model.

Details of the work can be found [here](http://kevinkaixu.net/projects/grass.html).

A PyTorch implementation (currently with only the VAE part) is available at: https://github.com/kevin-kaixu/grass_pytorch.

## Guide:

**Training**

Run trainTestVaeGan.m to train the vae-gan model on the provided chair dataset.

**Testing**

Use test_demo.m to generate shapes based on trained model. There is already a pre-trained model inside. The generated shape structures could be visulized in matlab.
